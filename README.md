# Learning about the intersection of botany and forensics
Flavio Vilcheze Espinoza and Jennifer Tang are the creaters of the Pollen website.  One day Flavio shared a book called The Nature of Life and Death by Patricia Wiltshire with Jennifer.  The book follows the professional career of Patricia Wiltshire as a forensic ecologist/botanist.  She studies and investigates plant and plant parts found at crime scenes.  The conversations Flavio and Jennifer had about the book spiraled into a shared interest in forensic botany.  After hours combing the Internet for resources on forensic botany and criminal cases solved by it to no avail, Flavio and Jennifer decided to build their own resource.  

## Mission
Pollen is an engaging and educational website on forensic botany.  Forensic botany is a niche field of forensic science that uses plants or plant parts in investigating criminal cases.  It is not widely known to many, thus, our mission is to educate those who never heard of forensic botany and show its societal impact.  Additionally, we want to create a space for forensic botany enthusiasts to learn and discover cases they werenâ€™t aware of.  

## Target Audience
The following are the three types of user we want to target in user story format.  
1. As a forensic botany enthusiast, I want access to a free and centralized resource so I can read, learn and study more criminal cases solved by investigating plant and plant parts found at crime scenes.  
2. As a true crime enthusiast, I want access to a free resource so I can read and learn more quirky criminal cases.  
3. As a curious individual who loves to read, I want access to a free resource so I can read and learn about.
