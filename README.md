# Pollen
## "Learning about the intersection of botany and forensics"
Pollen is an engaging and educational website on forensic botany.  Forensic botany is a niche field of forensic science that uses plants or plant parts in investigating criminal cases.  It is not widely known to many, thus, our mission is to educate those who never heard of forensic botany and show its societal impact.  Additionally, we want to create a space for forensic botany enthusiasts to learn and discover cases they werenâ€™t aware of.

## Target Users
The following are the three types of user we want to target in user story format.

2. As a true crime enthusiast, I want access to a free resource so I can read and learn more quirky criminal cases.  
3. As a curious individual who loves to read, I want access to a free resource so I can read and learn about.
