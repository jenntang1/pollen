The investigation into the killing of Mellory Manning — a 27-year-old woman who was assaulted and murdered in 2008 while working as a prostitute in Christchurch, New Zealand — confounded police.  They conducted an investigation and interviewed hundreds of people, but months later, they still had no solid leads.  To crack the case, the police required the expertise of an unusual specialist. Dallas Mildenhall, a white-haired scientist in his 70s, is a forensic palynologist – a pollen and spores expert who helps solve crimes. One of only a handful of such experts in the world, he has helped solve cases of murder, arson and art forgery all over the globe. He once traced counterfeit malaria drugs to the border of China and Vietnam by identifying pollen in the capsules.  Police turned to Mildenhall, who lives in Christchurch, when their investigation into the Manning case got stuck.  \"One of the major reasons why [the investigation] was stuck is that the police could not say for sure where she had been killed,\" David Wolman, who wrote about the case for Matter magazine, tells NPR\'s Arun Rath. \"They were very suspicious early on of a gang called the Mongrel Mob because they were involved in prostitution — they had this sort of warehouse hangout not far from where the body was found. And yet they didn\'t have the evidence making that connection. All they had was supposition.  \"So the challenge for someone like Mildenhall, then, is to come in and look at pollen samples taken from Mellory\'s nasal passages and her clothing and try and link it to locations that the police are wondering about as far as potential scenes for the crime.\"  A single pollen grain from a sample tells you nothing. But together, all the pollen grains in a sample — their composition and concentration — can reveal a lot. Still, we\'re talking about pollen grains, their details invisible to the naked eye.  Mildenhall examined pollen from potential crime scenes around Christchurch, but came up with nothing. Then, after months of peering through the microscope at tiny slides, he saw something almost unbelievable.  He was examining a kind of pollen grain that normally contain only a single pore. But Mildenhall \"noticed a pollen grain that looked like it had two pores,\" says Wolman. \"It really doesn\'t sound that exciting ... and at first, he thought it was just a trick of the microscope or a sample maybe had been smushed or deformed — because to get a sense of how rare it was, how dramatic this finding was, he said it would be like seeing a dog with five legs.\"  Mildenhall examined the pollen taken from Manning\'s corpse and noted multiple examples of these highly unusual, two-pored pollen grains. He shared his theory with the police: An herbicide had caused a mutation in the pollen, giving it more than one pore.  \"Sure enough,\" says Wolman, \"the area right next to the Mongrel Mob hangout and warehouse had been sprayed precisely at the time of year that Mildenhall suspected.\"  The police told Mildenhall to reexamine pollen samples collected from the gang\'s warehouse. \"And so he spent three days poring over these samples again,\" Wolman says. \"And then, lo and behold, he started to find significant concentrations of this two-pored pollen grain.\"  That clinched it. The pollen embedded in Mellory Manning\'s clothing during her murder was solidly linked to the Mongrel Mob\'s hangout. Police interrogated a suspect and presented him with this forensic evidence, \"saying, \'Look, we can connect you to this place at that time of year,\' and that rattled him enough that then he started to sing,\" Wolman says.  Last year, gang member Mauha Huataki Fawcett was convicted of Manning\'s murder and sentenced to life in prison.  If pollen can play a crucial part in solving a case like this, why isn\'t it used more often? Wolman says that like much forensic evidence, it can be hard for judges and juries to understand. But studying it is also difficult, time-consuming work — and scientists who have this expertise are about as rare in the world as two-pored pollen. And there may be no one who sees the world like Dallas Mildenhall.  \"Dallas Mildenhall is a guy who, he doesn\'t look through the air at the landscapes in front of him,\" Wolman says. \"He sees this blizzard of activity in the world around us, constantly, of pollen grains swirling and storming and rising and falling and raining down on the ground. The trick is being able to read that rain.\"\r\n'),
(2, 'How Trees Help Solve Murders', 'https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-trees-help-solve-murders', 'IN JUNE OF 2015, A woman out walking her dog on the shore of Boston’s Deer Island came across a garbage bag, opened it up, and found the body of a dead baby girl, wrapped in a fleece blanket. It was a nightmare scenario, and a very difficult case. The victim’s clothes were generic, and the water had rubbed off her fingerprints. An autopsy revealed next to nothing. A computer-generated image of the girl, nicknamed “Baby Doe,” was blasted across the nation’s social networks, but turned up no clues. Indeed, detectives knew nothing about her—until they found some pine pollen on her blanket. This told them that she was local, significantly narrowing the scope of the investigation. By September, she had been identified, and suspects are currently on trial.  Another case solved with forensic botany. For forensic botanists, plants make up a whole class of readily available witnesses. They can’t spill their guts, or confess what they overheard, but when it comes to many the questions involved in solving a crime—the who, when, and where especially—their mere presence is enough. A unique seed pod found in a suspect’s pickup can cast suspicion on his self-proclaimed whereabouts, as happened in a 1993 Arizona case involving a murdered woman found beneath a paloverde tree. Or marijuana confiscated from different sites can be DNA-analyzed, with identical strains used to trace drug traffickers.  The first botanist to branch out into forensics was Arthur Koehler, who, as a wood expert at the United States Forest Products Laboratory, lent his expertise to a number of cases in the 1920s and ’30s. Koehler used his knowledge of tree taxonomy and cellular structure to testify about the provenance of wood used in homemade bombs and weapons. Most famously, he served as a star expert witness in the so-called Trial of the Century, the 1935 Lindbergh Kidnapping Case.  When Koehler took the stand in court, the defense originally objected, saying that “there is no animal known among men as an expert in wood,” and calling him “merely a man who has had a lot of experience in examining trees.” But by the end of the trial, Koehler had convinced the jury that, based on microscopic examination and his own robust carpentry experience, he could determine the exact provenance of the ladder found leaning into the window of the crime scene. After he traced it back to a lumberyard in the Bronx—and matched one of its replaced rungs to a plank of wood found in carpenter Bruno Hauptmann’s attic—Hauptmann was convicted, and, soon after, executed.  Eight decades later, Koehler’s legacy continues. Plenty of botanists, at the Forest Products Laboratory and elsewhere, now moonlight as consultants. As a paleoecologist, Sara Hotchkiss, a professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, spends most of her time trying to figure out how human activity impacted historical ecosystems—but when the coroner’s office calls her up, she knows how to help them solve more current problems. “The same methods I can use to reconstruct what used to grow here thousands of years ago are the methods that you might use to reconstruct where this thing has been over the past few weeks or months, or when something died,” she says.   Digging into particular mysteries solved by forensic botany is, like most exercises of this type, largely sad and gruesome. Last year, There was the woman in Taipei who was originally thought to have died in a hit-and-run accident until leaves were found in her hair; experts determined that they came from a potted plant a few stories above the street, and that the woman had jumped out the window, hitting the plant on the way down. There was the elderly Florida man found chopped up in pieces around South Florida. Twigs and leaves found in the buckets with his body parts matched up with a tree in his accused killer’s front yard.  Despite all this blood and drama, actual forensic botanists are quick to point out that the job is less Law & Order: S-Tree-U and more daily science grind. “I think a lot of people have this idea that forensic work is bells, whistles, whodunit, and drama,” says Alex Widenhoeft, a botanist at the Center for Wood Anatomy Research. “The truth is much less colorful.” His favorite days are spent at the microscope, poring over samples: “Good, clean fun, but not very dramatic.”  Hotchkiss emphasizes the great uncertainties that come with her work, and the lack of one-to-one answers available to anyone working with such fickle subjects. “Pollen is tiny and it flies around, and it’s going to be variable in any given area,” she says. Having a sample of it might, at best, make the map smaller. “So that’s the kind of thing we’re looking at—what are the limits you can put on the analysis?” (Using true crime-style framings makes this statistical analysis much more exciting for her students, she says.)  Mostly, go through enough examples, and you begin to appreciate the sheer intractability of plants—how, by dint of being all around us, they worm themselves into our lives and our deaths. That tree you barely glance at every time you leave your house has been watching you much more closely. After you’re gone, it might even help solve your murder.'),
(3, 'Cases where forensic botany has been used in criminal investigations', 'https://deshasil.wixsite.com/independentlabs/single-post/2018/06/01/Cases-where-forensic-botany-has-been-used-in-criminal-investigations', 'Cases where forensic botany has been used in criminal investigations\r\nForensic botany is the use of plant evidence in court. Forensic botany is subdivided into several botanical subspecialties, including plant anatomy the study of cellular features, plant systematics taxonomy and species identification, palynology the study of pollen, plant ecology plant succession patterns, and limnology the study of freshwater ecology.  All these can be used as trace evidence to help reconstruct a crime scene or help in recreating previous events.  Forensic botany encompasses many sub disciplines, including plant anatomy, plant ecology, plant systematics, plant molecular biology, palynology, and limnology. Although the field of forensic botany has been recognized since the mid-1900’s, the use of trace plant material as physical evidence in criminal casework is still novel.  Forensic botany is still an under-utilized resource in forensic casework, although it has been used on occasion. It is an area of specialty science that could include traditional botanical classification of species, DNA, or materials evidence (trace and transfer evidence), crime mapping or geo-sourcing, all dependent on the specific case application under consideration.  The major plant groups identified as pollen sources include flowering plants, conifers, and ferns. Ferns technically produce spores instead of pollen but are included in pollen types. Pollen is microscopic and not visually obvious trace evidence during crime scene collection but is retained on clothing, embedded in carpets and pervasive in soil. Pollen grain morphology can be used to identify a plant genus and often the species. Crime scenes that are restricted to a few square meters, such as a rape scene or the entry point of a burglary, are good choices for pollen evidence. Localized areas have a specific pollen distribution pattern representing the combination of plant species found in the surrounding vegetation. Common pollen types from plants that use wind for distribution will be less useful than pollen from uncommon, poorly distributed species. Insect distributed pollen is typically deposited within a few feet of the source plant. Pollen analysis consists of species identification and an estimation of the percentage that each plant species represents in an evidentiary sample.  A similar pollen composition from shoeprints and from the shoes that made the prints indicates a strong match correlation. Pollen evidence collected from a burglary entrance and a suspect’s shoes, for example, could provide a linkage in a case.  There are a number of cases were botany was used to solve problems to investigations and findings. The first case that I will be looking at which was successful using botany was the Bosnia case in 1997 to 2002 when a team of forensic personnel worked with the United Nations International Criminal Tribune to exhume war graves in North East Bosnia. Reports stated that in 1995 hundreds of Serbians were massacred and buried in 7 large graves. Other reports stated that 3 months later, most bodies were exhumed and reburied in many secondary graves to appear to be local burials. 240 pollen samples were collected from primary and secondary sites to determine if the bodies in secondary graves were original or if they had been exhumed and reburied from the 7 mass graves. The pollen evidence confirmed that the bodies had been killed and buried in one location and then exhumed and moved to a new location.');
